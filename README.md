# ICS4U-Game
Treasure Hunter

This was the first repository I ever set up so it is a mess!

There is a working version of the game under /EstebanEXE

You will need Python3/pygame installed for the game to run

if the .exe does not work, cd into the downloaded repository and run mn2.py using the command prompt.

Have fun!
